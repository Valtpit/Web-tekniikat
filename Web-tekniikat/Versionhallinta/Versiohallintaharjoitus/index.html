            <h2>Introduction to version control</h2>
            
            <p>Version control is the management of changes to documents, 
                computer programs, large web sites and other collections 
                of information. These changes are usually termed as 'versions' 
                or 'revisions.
            </p>

            <p>A revision represents a change to a document's contents, or 
                a modification to a part such that the part remains 
                interchangeable with its previous variation.
            </p>
            
            <p>A version as an optional alias for a revision. While item 
                revisions typically identify discrete steps in the evolution 
                of an item, versions often are not sequential. 
                Versions are commonly used for computer program files 
                to identify: <br>
                - a specific set of features,<br>
                - a set of bug fixes, and/or<br>
                - a particular build number.                
            </p>
